<p>This one is different as it was trying to break into another machine.</p>

<p>So, lets start:</p>

<p>We begin with netdiscover to find out the IP of the target machine.</p>

<p>I then use nmap to check what services are running</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox2.PNG"</p>
  
<p>They&#39;ve got FTP open, so I check what they have on there.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox3.PNG"</p>

<p>I download the file to find:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox4.PNG"</p>

<p>I tried to see if I could find anything with steghide, but a password is needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox22_edit.PNG"</p>

<p>So, I went back to http to see if I could find anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox5.PNG"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I took their advice and decided to not overthink it and tried to enumerate the directories to see if there was anything else I could find.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>/blogs/ looked like the most promising, so I had a look and:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox7.PNG"</p>

<p>Clearly there was more to that message, so I did inspect element and:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox8.PNG"</p>

<p>There is a hidden reference to another path, so I go there, and the message there is obviously there to throw you off, and since inspect element was open anyway, the hidden message showed up straight away.</p>

<p>Secret key is exactly what I need for that image, so I try again...</p>

<p>A message to renu gives us all we need to try and brute force our way in with hydra:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox12.PNG"</p>

<p>With the username and password, I can now ssh into the machine:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox13.PNG"</p>

<p>The first flag is very easy to find:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox14_flag1.PNG"</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find anything else in this user&#39;s files, but I did find another user, lily, and again the second flag is right there in plain sight:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox15_flag2.PNG"</p>

<p>Still in lily&#39;s files, I found that she had the ssh key from renu, which means we could easily just ssh from renu into lily and check what privileges she has.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox16.PNG"</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox17.PNG"</p>
 
<p>As lily, she is able to use perl.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox19.PNG"</p>
  
<p>I looked up a simple perl privilege escalation command and was able to get root!</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox20.PNG"</p>

<p>And finally as root, I found the final flag!</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmarG13/Portfolio/main/CTF_PenTest/MoneyBox1/Images/moneybox21_flag3.PNG"</p>

<p>Success!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was a fun one, I much prefer attempting to get into a machine this way instead of the code side of things (only because I&#39;m not proficient at coding).</p>
