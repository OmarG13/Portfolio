<p>We are provided with a pcap which I open with wireshark and start scrolling through the data. A story emerges of a plutonium sale and then some encrypted data. During the email exchanges one of the parties says &quot;We are very XORry but the management does not approve such a sale. It may damage our business.&quot;&nbsp; This leads me to believe that this is another XOR cipher.</p>

<p>There were a few encrypted messages and it took me a bit of time playing around with cyberchef to figure the way to crack it! Basically, there are 3 hex strings in the messages and if you use 2 of them as the recipe (making sure to start off with &quot;From Hex&quot; because it took me a while to realise I&#39;d forgotten that) and the last one as the input, you get the flag!</p>
